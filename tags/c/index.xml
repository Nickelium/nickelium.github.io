      <description>DoomDashers is a fast-paced, bloody 2D platformer where two to four players battle each other to survive. Next to dashing and charging on your foes, the players need to dodge the disruptive surroundings filled with unexpected traps and bombs. Players choose between the Viking/Knight/Samurai/Gladiator and fight the others and/or collaborate to be the last one standing.
This project was made with Unity in a timespan of three months, from March 2019 to May 2019.</description>
